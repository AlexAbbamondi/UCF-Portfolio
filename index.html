          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p class="about-info">
            I received a bachelor’s degree from Florida Atlantic University
            majoring in psychology. I wanted to pursue a different career route
            and discovered web development. I have just completed my degree in
            web development at Broward College with a focus on front end
            development. I also have recently obtained a certificate in
            programming from Palm Beach State College. Furthermore, I have
            completed a full stack development bootcamp utilizing the MERN
            stack. I have experience with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap,
            React, Redux, Sass, java, C#, VS Code, Visual Studio, MYSQL,
            Express, Node.js, and MongoDB. Currently I am in the process of
            getting my second Bachelor's degree. <br /><br />
            I am a team player who enjoys meeting new people and forming close
            working relationships. I am extremely organized, hardworking, and
            motivated to finish the tasks at hand. I believe that my high work
            ethics and social abilities are what is needed to fulfill the
            employer’s needs ensuring an enjoyable work environment and
            maintaining excellent company-client relations. I have been
            commended for my work in my current field and am sure that I can
            become a valued member of your team.
